cloth.js
========

cloth.js is a general-purpose library for now. This will be used for developing HTML5 applications. At the moment, most of its usefulness is in the toolkit where all the roughly implemented helper functions are at. The toolkit resembles underscore.js library but will be more focused on the manipulation of Cloth graphics objects.

The structure of the code is still in a very early design stage.
